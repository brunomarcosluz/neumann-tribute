                <p>
                  Hi my name is Bruno Marcos Luz and this text is to represent how J.V. Neumann 
                  inspire me and why will inspire you too.
                </p>
                <h4>Introduction</h4>
                <p>Neumann born in Budapest, Hungary, in your childhood Neumann 
                are a child prodigy he could divide two eght-digit numbers in his head
                and could converse in Ancient Greek, this when he was six years old.
                But this sincerely no one care how younger he can calculate Neumann is a 
                genius because in 53 years of life you contribuition. 
                </p>
                <h4>Contribuition</h4>
                <p>
                  Neumann has a foot in many fields of study including matamatics, physics, computing and economics
                  you work in computing define our modern computers, you can see
                  more about the Neumann Architecture <a id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture"
                  target="_blank">
                  here</a> you last work is the book <a id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Computer_and_the_Brain"
                  target="_blank">
                  The Computer and the Brain</a> he don't finished this book because he write in the hospital before you death.
                </p>
                <h4>My Conclusion</h4>
                <p>When i start study Computer Science i hear the story about John Von Neumann and you work, Neumann show to me
                  how to be a good student, professional and of course autodidactic. Thank you Neumann rest in peace.
                </p>
